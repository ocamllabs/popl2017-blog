Observation: during edition, a program is just a piece of text, not a program yet.
No syntactic guarantee.

Classic solution: add holes to the syntax to represent incomplete pieces.

How to reason statically about that?

# Contribution

Static semantics for a bidirectional calculus with holes.

Related to gradual typing.
